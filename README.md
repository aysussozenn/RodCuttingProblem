# RodCuttingProblem
The rod cutting problem is a method for calculating the profit we can get by selling these pieces from a series that contains a rod and its parts.
I chose the bottom - up method for the application because in this method, the big problem is divided into small problems first, and the sub-problems are sorted by the number of dimensions, starting with the smallest one. In this case, each sub-problem is solved only once, and when we first see it, we have already solved all the prerequisite sub-problems.
